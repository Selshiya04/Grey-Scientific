# ### 1. Setup and Initial Configuration

- **Initialize the project**: Start with creating a new React application using Create React App.
- **Install necessary dependencies**: This might include `react-router-dom` for routing and a calendar UI library like `react-calendar` to simplify the calendar display.
- ### 2. Component Structure

- **Identify Main Components**: You'll need several key components:
    - `App`: The root component that manages routing.
    - `CalendarView`: To display the calendar and list events.
    - `EventForm`: A form for adding and editing events.
    - `EventDetails`: To show detailed information about an event.

### 3. Implement Components Using Class Components

- **Design the `App` component** to handle the routing of the application.
- **Create a `CalendarView` component** that incorporates the calendar display and hooks for event management.
- **Develop an `EventForm` component** to manage both adding and editing events through a form interface.
- **Set up an `EventDetails` component** to display detailed views of events, possibly in a modal or a separate page.

### 4. State Management

- **Use local state in class components** (`this.state` and `this.setState`) to handle the application's state like the current date, selected events, and form inputs.
- **Consider using the Context API** for more complex state management needs, such as sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling.

### 5. Routing and Navigation

- **Implement routing** using `react-router-dom` to enable navigation between the calendar view and individual event details.

### 6. Styling the Application

- **Decide on a styling approach**: Use CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styling to keep your application maintainable and scalable.
- **Ensure responsiveness**: Make sure your application looks good on different devices by using responsive design techniques.

### 7. Error Handling and Feedback

- **Implement error handling**: Provide feedback for user actions and show error messages when things go wrong.
- **Manage loading states**: Indicate when data is being fetched or submitted to enhance user experience.

### 8. Testing and Documentation

- **Write tests**: Cover your components with unit tests to ensure they work as expected.
- **Document the project**: Clearly document how to set up, run, and use your application, including descriptions of each component and their functions.

### 9. Deployment

- **Prepare for deployment**: Choose a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for deploying your application and making it accessible online.
